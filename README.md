  <strong>~5,055 source lines of JavaScript · ZERO runtime dependencies</strong>
  <br><br>
  <p>A minimal AI coding assistant. Runs locally, works with any LLM provider (Fireworks, OpenRouter, etc.), gives the model file + shell tools, and wraps it in a ReAct loop.</p>
  <p>The whole point is to be readable—small enough to understand end-to-end.</p>

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmoreton/TIM.git && cd TIM
npm link # installs the `tim` binary globally

tim /env set FIREWORKS_API_KEY=...
tim /env set OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
tim /env set TAVILY_API_KEY=...   # optional, enables web_search
```

---

## Concepts

TIM has four building blocks. Knowing how they fit together makes everything else click.

```
agent          ← identity + memory + tool allowlist + system prompt
  └─ workflow  ← task spec bound to an agent (inherits identity + memory)
       └─ trigger  ← cron schedule that fires a workflow
```

- **Agent** — a long-lived persona. Owns a memory file (auto-loaded into every run), an optional tool allowlist, and a system prompt. Example: `traveling-developer` — your YouTube/X brand identity.
- **Workflow** — a task spec bound to an owning agent. Inherits the agent's identity + memory and adds task-specific instructions (and optionally a narrower tool allowlist). Example: `youtube-daily-report` — owned by `traveling-developer`, runs daily analytics + email.
- **Trigger** — a cron schedule that fires a workflow with an optional task override. The `tim start` daemon runs them.
- **Memory** — per-agent persistent context at `$TIM_DIR/memory/<agent>.md`. Auto-loaded into the system prompt each turn. The agent calls `append_memory` to save durable findings.

Inside a chat, the model can also create these for you via the `create_agent` and `create_workflow` tools — no need to learn the file format.

---

## Building your first agent

Three paths, same canonical file format.

### From inside a chat (easiest)

```
tim
> create an agent called "research" that focuses on web research and
  summarization. give it web_fetch, web_search, append_memory, spawn_workflow.
```

The model calls `create_agent` and writes `$TIM_DIR/agents/research.md` with the canonical schema. Memory file bootstrapped at `$TIM_DIR/memory/research.md`.

### Interactive CLI

```bash
tim agent new
```

Walks through name → description → tools → system prompt and writes the file.

### Hand-edit

Drop a markdown file in `$TIM_DIR/agents/`:

```md
---
# Agent identifier (kebab-case)
name: research

# One-line description shown in `tim agent list`
description: Web research + summarization

# Optional model override (e.g. claude-sonnet-4-6)
# model:

# Tool allowlist — omit for all tools
tools: [web_fetch, web_search, append_memory, spawn_workflow]
---

You are the research agent. ...
```

The schema is validated on load — typos, missing required fields, and wrong types (e.g. `tools: foo, bar` instead of `tools: [foo, bar]`) print clear errors with "did you mean" suggestions.

**Run the agent:**
```bash
tim research                 # interactive REPL with this agent
tim research "task here"     # interactive REPL, with an initial task
tim run research "task"      # headless, print result
```

---

## Adding a workflow

Workflows are reusable task specs bound to an agent. Same three paths.

### From a chat

```
tim research
> add a workflow called "morning-research" owned by the research agent. each
  morning it should pull HN top stories and summarize the 3 most relevant ones.
```

### CLI

```bash
tim workflow new
```

### Hand-edit

```md
---
name: morning-research
description: Daily HN summary
agent: research

# Default user message sent when fired without an override (used by triggers)
task: Pull top 3 HN stories and summarize

# Override the agent's tool allowlist for this workflow (optional)
# tools: [web_fetch]
---

When summarizing, structure as: title, 1-line takeaway, why it matters.
```

**`task` vs body:** `task` is the default user message (the question/instruction sent to the agent when fired). The body is the system-prompt extension that defines HOW the agent should approach this kind of task — appended to the agent's base prompt at runtime.

**Run a workflow:**
```bash
tim run morning-research                       # uses default task
tim run morning-research "custom task"         # override task
# Or from inside an agent: spawn_workflow("morning-research", "task")
```

---

## Scheduling with triggers

Triggers fire workflows on a cron schedule. The `tim start` daemon runs them.

```bash
tim trigger add morning-research-daily   # interactive: schedule, workflow, optional task
tim trigger list                         # see all
tim trigger run <name>                   # fire immediately for testing
tim trigger remove <name>
tim start                                # run the daemon (auto-restarts on crash)
```

Or hand-edit `$TIM_DIR/triggers/<name>.md`:

```md
---
name: morning-research-daily
schedule: "0 8 * * *"
workflow: morning-research
# task: optional override
---
```

---

## Custom tools

Drop a `.js` file in `src/tools/` that exports `tools = { name: { schema, run } }`:

```js
// src/tools/my_thing.js
export const tools = {
  my_thing: {
    schema: {
      type: "function",
      function: {
        name: "my_thing",
        description: "Does my thing.",
        parameters: {
          type: "object",
          properties: { x: { type: "string" } },
          required: ["x"],
        },
      },
    },
    run: async ({ x }, ctx) => `result: ${x}`,
    // Optional — silently dropped if env vars missing:
    // requiredEnv: "MY_API_KEY",
  },
};
```

Save and restart `tim`. Auto-discovered. No registry edits, no `index.js` changes. One file can register multiple tools — see `src/tools/fs.js` (4 tools) or `src/tools/scaffold.js` (2 tools) for examples.

## `.tim` Directory Structure

TIM stores all user data, configuration, and state in `~/.tim` (or `$TIM_DIR`):

```
~/.tim/
├── .env                    # API keys and env vars (auto-loaded)
├── TIM.md                  # global rules + directory conventions (auto-bootstrapped)
├── agents/                 # Agent profiles (*.md with frontmatter)
├── workflows/              # Workflow task specs (*.md)
├── triggers/               # Scheduled cron triggers (*.md)
├── memory/                 # Agent memory files (*.md)
├── sessions/               # Saved conversation history (JSON, grouped by folder)
└── output/                 # All agent-generated artifacts (see below)
    ├── youtube/
    │   ├── images/         # screenshots auto-routed here when youtube agent is active
    │   ├── thumbnails/
    │   └── scripts/
    ├── research/
    │   └── reports/
    └── general/            # bare REPL / `tim chat` (no specific agent)
```

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.env` | Environment variables auto-loaded on startup. Set via `/env set KEY=val` |
| `TIM.md` | Global rules + directory conventions. Loaded into every system prompt |
| `agents/` | Agent identity profiles (schema-validated on load) |
| `workflows/` | Task specs bound to an agent (schema-validated on load) |
| `triggers/` | Cron-scheduled workflows. Run by `tim start` daemon |
| `memory/` | Persistent agent memory. Auto-loaded into context |
| `sessions/` | Saved REPL conversations. Resume with `tim --resume` or `/sessions` |
| `output/<agent>/<kind>/` | Everything an agent produces — reports, drafts, images, data. The system prompt tells the model to write here, screenshots auto-route here. |

A project-local `TIM.md` in your cwd is also loaded (after the global one) — use it for project-specific rules.
